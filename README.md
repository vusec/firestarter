[FIRestarter: Practical Software Crash Recovery with Targeted Library-level Fault Injection [DSN'21]](https://download.vusec.net/papers/firestarter_dsn21.pdf)

Despite advances in software testing, many bugs still plague deployed software, leading to crashes and thus service
disruption in high-availability production applications. Existing crash recovery solutions are either limited to transient faults or
require manual annotations to target predetermined persistent bugs. Moreover, existing solutions are generally inefficient, hindering
practical deployment.

We present __FIRestarter__ (Fault Injection-based
Restarter), an efficient and automatic crash recovery solution for
commodity user applications. To eliminate the need for manual
annotations, FIRestarter injects targeted software faults at the
library interface to automatically trigger error handling code
for standard library calls already part of the application. In
particular, when a crash occurs, we roll back the application state
before the last recoverable library call, inject a fault, and restart
execution forcing the call to immediately return a predetermined
error code. This strategy allows the application to automatically
bypass the crashing code upon such a restart and exploits
existing error-handling code to recover from even persistent
bugs. Moreover, since library calls lie pervasively throughout the
code, our design provides a large recovery surface despite the
automated approach. Finally, FIRestarterâ€™s recovery windows are
small and frequent compared to traditional checkpoint-restart,
which enables new optimizations such as the ability to support
rollback by means of hybrid hardware/software transactional
memory instrumentation and improve performance. We apply
FIRestarter to a number of event-driven server applications and
show our solution achieves near-instantaneous, state-preserving
crash recovery in the face of even persistent crashes. On popular
web servers, our evaluation results show a recovery surface of
at least 77%, with low performance overhead of at most 17%.

### Source code

We publish the source code here, during the conference in June 21-24, 2021.

## Setup

1. Install prerequisites:
   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install -y bison flex g++-4.8 gcc-4.8 gcc-multilib  \
     build-essential apt-utils dialog sudo vim wget python python3.6  \
     python-dev libssl1.0.0 libssl-dev libncurses5-dev psmisc gdb     \
     strace ltrace ssh time automake
   ```
   Also build LLVM 4.0 with LTO support using LLVMgold plugin. (https://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html)

2. Switch to the gold version of `ld`.
   ```
   $ sudo ./switchld.sh gold
   ```
   
3. Run the script `autosetup-firestarter.sh` in the root of the repository.
    ```
    $ git clone <firestarter repo url>
    $ cd firestarter
    $ ./autosetup-firestarter.sh
    ```
       
4. Update the values in `common.overrides.conf.inc` file.
   ```
   LLVMBASEDIR: If LLVM binaries are in <DIR>/llvm-4.0/bin/bin, then set it to <DIR>.
   ```
   Update the `common.overrides.llvm.inc` file, for any necessary adjustments.

## Instrumentation and execution
  
1. We use our ```Kombit``` framework for instrumenting target applications with FIRestarter and running them.

2. The directory, ```kombiton/configs```, have the various configurations of instrumentations. Run the following command to try them out:
   ```
   Usage: kombit < config file path > [instrument | execute]
   ```
   Examples:
   ```
    $ kombit kombiton/configs/baseline/ngx.baseline.cfg
    $ kombit kombiton/configs/overhead/firestarter-with-autoadapt/ngx.libcall_hybrid_autoadapt__sz4_t1__tsxtries1.cfg
    $ kombit kombiton/configs/bugs/lighttpd.bug2780_libcall_hybrid__with_profiling.cfg instrument \
      && cd bugs/lighttpd-1.4.44--bug2780 && ./repro-2780.sh
   ```

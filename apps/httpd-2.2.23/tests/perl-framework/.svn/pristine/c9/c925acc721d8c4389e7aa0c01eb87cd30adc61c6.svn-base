Stuff to do:
    * finish the t/TEST exit code issue (ORed with 0x2C if
      framework failed)

    * change existing tests that frob the DocumentRoot (e.g.,
      t/modules/access.t) to *not* do that; instead, have
      Makefile.PL prepare appropriate subdirectory configs
      for them.  Why?  So t/TEST can be used to test a
      remote server.

    * problems with -d perl mode, doesn't work as documented

Tests to be written:

    * t/apache
      - simulations of network failures (incomplete POST bodies,
        chunked and unchunked; missing POST bodies; slooow
        client connexions, such as taking 1 minute to send
        1KiB; ...)

    * t/modules/autoindex
      - something seems possibly broken with inheritance on 2.0

    * t/ssl
      - SSLPassPhraseDialog exec:
      - SSLRandomSeed exec:

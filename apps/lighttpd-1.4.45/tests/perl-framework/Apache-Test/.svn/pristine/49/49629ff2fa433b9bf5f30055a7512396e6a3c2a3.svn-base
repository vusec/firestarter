# this vhost entry is needed to check that when t/TEST -maxclients 1
# or similar is called after t/TEST -conf was run, and extra.conf
# includes a vhost entry and httpd.conf includes an autogenerated
# vhost entry from some .pm file, we used to have a collision, since
# extra.conf wasn't reparsed and the same port was getting assigned to
# more than one vhost entry, preventing server startup:
#
#default_ VirtualHost overlap on port 8530, the first has precedence
#(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address
#0.0.0.0:8530 no listening sockets available, shutting down
#
# XXX: for now using a dummy vhost entry.  later if needed to put a
# real vhost entry in ths file, the dummy one can be removed
#
<VirtualHost foo_bar_tar>
</VirtualHost>

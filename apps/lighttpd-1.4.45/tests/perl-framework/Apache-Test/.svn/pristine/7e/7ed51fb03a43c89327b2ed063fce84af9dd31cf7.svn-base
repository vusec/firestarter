The Apache-Test project is co-maintained by several developers, who
take turns at making CPAN releases. Therefore you may find several
CPAN directories containing Apache-Test releases. The best way to find
the latest release is to use http://search.cpan.org/.

If you have a question or you want to submit a bug report or make a
contribution, please do not email individual authors, but send an
email to the test-dev <at> httpd.apache.org mailing list. This list is
moderated, so unless you are subscribed to it, your message will have
to be approved first by a moderator. Therefore please allow some time
(up to a few days) for your post to propagate to the list.

If 'make test' fails to start, with an error message:

  !!! no test server configured, please specify an httpd or apxs or put
  either in your PATH. For example: t/TEST -httpd /path/to/bin/httpd

or similar, please don't submit a bug report, since this is a user
error, not a bug in Apache-Test. Instead, do what the error message
suggests; Apache-Test needs to know where it can find Apache and other
components. If you have apxs installed you can run the test suite via:

  % t/TEST -apxs /path/to/bin/apxs

or if you set the APXS environment variable, via make:

  % APXS=/path/to/bin/apxs make test

If you don't have 'apxs', tell Apache-Test where your httpd can be
found:

  % t/TEST -httpd /path/to/bin/httpd

or via the APACHE environment variable:

  % APACHE=/path/to/bin/httpd make test

*** CPAN Testers ***

CPAN Testers using CPANPLUS and running under 'root' are required to
update their perl installation to have IPC::Run 0.78 or higher. Please
do not post failure reports unless you have this prerequisite
satisfied. It has nothing to do with Apache-Test itself, and needed
for CPANPLUS to flush the STDERR and STDOUT streams at the right time,
allowing you to skip the test suite if the conditions aren't suitable
for its execution.

*** Apache C modules bug reports ***

It's now possible to easily create tarballs with self-contained bug
reports for Apache modules in C. Geoff developed and maintains the 
skeleton:

   http://perl.apache.org/~geoff/bug-reporting-skeleton-apache.tar.gz

So next time you want to send a reproducable bug report for some C module,
grab that tarball, put your code in and submit it to the relevant list.

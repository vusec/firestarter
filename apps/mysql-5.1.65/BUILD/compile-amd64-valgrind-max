******************************************************************************
Note that by default BUILD/compile-pentium-valgrind-max calls 'configure' with
--enable-assembler. When Valgrind detects an error involving an assembly
function (for example an uninitialized value used as an argument of an
assembly function), Valgrind will not print the stacktrace and 'valgrind
--gdb-attach=yes' will not work either. If you need a stacktrace in those
cases, you have to run BUILD/compile-pentium-valgrind-max with the
--disable-assembler argument.

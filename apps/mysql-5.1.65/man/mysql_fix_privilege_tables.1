In MySQL 5\&.1\&.7,
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR
was superseded by
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, which should be used instead\&. See
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR(1)\&.

Some releases of MySQL introduce changes to the structure of the system tables in the
mysql
database to add new privileges or support new features\&. When you update to a new version of MySQL, you should update your system tables as well to make sure that their structure is up to date\&. Otherwise, there might be capabilities that you cannot take advantage of\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR
is an older script that previously was used to upgrade the system tables in the
mysql
database after a MySQL upgrade\&.
.PP
Before running
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR, make a backup of your
mysql
database\&.
.PP
On Unix or Unix\-like systems, update the system tables by running the
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR
script:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
You must run this script while the server is running\&. It attempts to connect to the server running on the local host as
root\&. If your
root
account requires a password, indicate the password on the command line like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables \-\-password=\fR\fB\fIroot_password\fR\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fBmysql_fix_privilege_tables\fR
script performs any actions necessary to convert your system tables to the current format\&. You might see some
Duplicate column name
warnings as it runs; you can ignore them\&.
.PP
After running the script, stop the server and restart it so that any changes made to the system tables take effect\&.
.PP
On Windows systems, MySQL distributions include a
mysql_fix_privilege_tables\&.sql
SQL script that you can run using the
\fBmysql\fR
client\&. For example, if your MySQL installation is located at
C:\eProgram Files\eMySQL\eMySQL Server 5\&.1, the commands look like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
C:\e> \fBcd "C:\eProgram Files\eMySQL\eMySQL Server 5\&.1"\fR
C:\e> \fBbin\emysql \-u root \-p mysql\fR
mysql> \fBSOURCE share/mysql_fix_privilege_tables\&.sql\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
Prior to version 5\&.1\&.17, the
mysql_fix_privilege_tables\&.sql
script is found in the
scripts
directory\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
The
\fBmysql\fR
command will prompt you for the
root
password; enter it when prompted\&.
.PP
If your installation is located in some other directory, adjust the path names appropriately\&.
.PP
As with the Unix procedure, you might see some
Duplicate column name
warnings as
\fBmysql\fR
processes the statements in the
mysql_fix_privilege_tables\&.sql
script; you can ignore them\&.
.PP
After running the script, stop the server and restart it\&.

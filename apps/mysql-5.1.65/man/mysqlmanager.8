\fBmysqlmanager\fR
is the MySQL Instance Manager (IM)\&. This program monitors and manages MySQL Database Server instances\&. MySQL Instance Manager is available for Unix\-like operating systems, as well as Windows\&. It runs as a daemon that listens on a TCP/IP port\&. On Unix, it also listens on a Unix socket file\&.
.PP
MySQL Instance Manager can be used in place of the
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
script to start and stop one or more instances of MySQL Server\&. Because Instance Manager can manage multiple server instances, it can also be used in place of the
\fBmysqld_multi\fR
script\&. Instance Manager offers these capabilities:

The MySQL Instance Manager supports a number of command options\&. For a brief listing, invoke
\fBmysqlmanager\fR

\fB\-\-help\fR

/etc/my\&.cnf\&. To specify a different configuration file, start Instance Manager with the
\fB\-\-defaults\-file\fR

This section discusses how Instance Manager starts server instances when it starts\&. However, before you start Instance Manager, you should set up a password file for it\&. Otherwise, you will not be able to connect to Instance Manager to control it after it starts\&. For details about creating Instance Manager accounts, see
the section called \(lqINSTANCE MANAGER USER AND PASSWORD MANAGEMENT\(rq\&.
.PP
On Unix, the
\fBmysqld\fR
MySQL database server normally is started with the
\fBmysql\&.server\fR
script, which usually resides in the
/etc/init\&.d/
folder\&. That script invokes the
\fBmysqld_safe\fR
script by default\&. However, you can use Instance Manager instead if you modify the
/etc/my\&.cnf
configuration file by adding
use\-manager
to the
[mysql\&.server]
section:
.sp
.if n \{\

.PP
Before MySQL 5\&.1\&.12, Instance Manager always tries to start at least one server instance: When it starts, it reads its configuration file if it exists to find server instance sections and prepare a list of instances\&. Instance sections have names of the form
[mysqld]
or
[mysqld\fIN\fR], where
\fIN\fR
is an unsigned integer (for example,
[mysqld1],
[mysqld2], and so forth)\&.
.PP
After preparing the list of instances, Instance Manager starts the guarded instances in the list\&. If there are no instances, Instance Manager creates an instance named
mysqld
and attempts to start it with default (compiled\-in) configuration values\&. This means that the Instance Manager cannot find the
\fBmysqld\fR
program if it is not installed in the default location\&. (Section\ \&2.1.5, \(lqInstallation Layouts\(rq, describes default locations for components of MySQL distributions\&.) If you have installed the MySQL server in a nonstandard location, you should create the Instance Manager configuration file\&.
.PP
The startup behavior just described is similar to that of
\fBmysqld_safe\fR, which always attempts to start a server\&. However, it lacks the flexibility required for some operations because it is not possible to run Instance Manager in such a way that it refrains from starting any server instances\&. For example, you cannot invoke Instance Manager for the purpose of configuring an instance without also starting it (a task that a MySQL installer application might want to perform)\&. Consequently, MySQL 5\&.1\&.12 introduces the following changes:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
A new option,
\fB\-\-mysqld\-safe\-compatible\fR, may be used to cause Instance Manager to run with startup behavior similar to that used before MySQL 5\&.1\&.12: If Instance Manager finds a
[mysqld]
instance section in the configuration file, it will start it\&. If Instance Manager finds no
[mysqld]
section, it creates one using default configuration values, writes a
[mysqld]
section to the configuration file if it is accessible, and starts the
mysqld
instance\&. Instance Manager also starts any other guarded instances listed in the configuration file\&.

.RE
.PP
Instance Manager also stops all guarded server instances when it shuts down\&.
.PP
The permissible options for
[mysqld\fIN\fR]
server instance sections are described in
the section called \(lqMYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER CONFIGURATION FILES\(rq\&. In these sections, you can use a special
\fBmysqld\-path=\fR\fB\fIpath\-to\-mysqld\-binary\fR\fR
option that is recognized only by Instance Manager\&. Use this option to let Instance Manager know where the
\fBmysqld\fR
binary resides\&. If there are multiple instances, it may also be necessary to set other options such as
\fBdatadir\fR
and
\fBport\fR, to ensure that each instance has a different data directory and TCP/IP port number\&.

For operations on the password file to succeed, the file must exist and it must be accessible by Instance Manager\&. (The exception is
\fB\-\-clean\-password\-file\fR, which creates the file if it does not exist\&.

CREATE INSTANCE \fIinstance_name\fR [\fIoption_name\fR[=\fIoption_value\fR], \&.\&.\&.]
.sp
This command configures a new instance by creating an
[\fIinstance_name\fR]
section in the configuration file\&. The command fails if
\fIinstance_name\fR
is not a valid instance name or the instance already exists\&.
.sp
The created section instance is empty if no options are given\&. Otherwise, the options are added to the section\&. Options should be given in the same format used when you write options in option files\&. (See
Section\ \&4.2.3.3, \(lqUsing Option Files\(rq
for a description of the permissible syntax\&.) If you specify multiple options, separate them by commas\&.
.sp
For example, to create an instance section named
[mysqld98], you might write something like this were you to modify the configuration file directly:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[mysqld98]
basedir=/var/mysql98
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To achieve the same effect using
CREATE INSTANCE, issue this command to Instance Manager:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
mysql> \fBCREATE INSTANCE mysqld98 basedir="/var/mysql98";\fR
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,00 sec)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
CREATE INSTANCE
creates the instance but does not start it\&.
.sp
If the instance name is the (deprecated) name
mysqld, the option list cannot include any options that are specific to Instance Manager, such as
nonguarded
(see
the section called \(lqMYSQL INSTANCE MANAGER CONFIGURATION FILES\(rq)\&.

The command lists all log files used by the instance\&. The result set contains the path to the log file and the log file size\&. If no log file path is specified in the instance section of the configuration file (for example,

SHOW \fIinstance_name\fR LOG {ERROR | SLOW | GENERAL} \fIsize\fR[,\fIoffset_from_end\fR]

This command retrieves a portion of the specified log file\&. Because most users are interested in the latest log messages, the

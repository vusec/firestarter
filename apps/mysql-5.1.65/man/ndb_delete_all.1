.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBndb_delete_all\fR
deletes all rows from the given
NDB
table\&. In some cases, this can be much faster than
DELETE
or even
TRUNCATE TABLE\&.
        Usage
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ndb_delete_all \-c \fIconnect_string\fR \fItbl_name\fR \-d \fIdb_name\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This deletes all rows from the table named
\fItbl_name\fR
in the database named
\fIdb_name\fR\&. It is exactly equivalent to executing
TRUNCATE \fIdb_name\fR\&.\fItbl_name\fR
in MySQL\&.
        Additional Options
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

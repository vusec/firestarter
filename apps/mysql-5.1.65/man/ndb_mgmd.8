The management server is the process that reads the cluster configuration file and distributes this information to all nodes in the cluster that request it\&. It also maintains a log of cluster activities\&. Management clients can connect to the management server and check the cluster\'s status\&.

This option, whose default value is

(or
TRUE, or

config\&.ini
every time it starts (see
Section\ \&17.3.2, \(lqMySQL Cluster Configuration Files\(rq)\&. You can do this by starting the

\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
.RE
.RS 4
Using one of the options just listed is effective only if the management server has no stored configuration at the time it is started\&. If the management server finds any configuration cache files, then the
\fB\-\-config\-cache\fR
option or the
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
option is ignored\&. Therefore, to disable configuration caching, the option should be used the
\fIfirst\fR
time that the management server is started\&. Otherwise\(emthat is, if you wish to disable configuration caching for a management server that has
\fIalready\fR
created a configuration cache\(emyou must stop the management server, delete any existing configuration cache files manually, then restart the management server with
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
(or with
\fB\-\-config\-cache\fR
set equal to 0,
OFF, or
FALSE)\&.
.sp
Configuration cache files are normally created in a directory named
mysql\-cluster
under the installation directory (unless this location has been overridden using the
\fB\-\-configdir\fR
option)\&. Each time the management server updates its configuration data, it writes a new cache file\&. The files are named sequentially in order of creation using the following format:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ndb_\fInode\-id\fR_config\&.bin\&.\fIseq\-number\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fInode\-id\fR
is the management server\'s node ID;
\fIseq\-number\fR
is a sequence number, beginning with 1\&. For example, if the management server\'s node ID is 5, then the first three configuration cache files would, when they are created, be named
ndb_5_config\&.bin\&.1,
ndb_5_config\&.bin\&.2, and
ndb_5_config\&.bin\&.3\&.
.sp
If your intent is to purge or reload the configuration cache without actually disabling caching, you should start
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
with one of the options
\fB\-\-reload\fR
or
\fB\-\-initial\fR
instead of
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR\&.
.sp
To re\-enable the configuration cache, simply restart the management server, but without the
\fB\-\-config\-cache\fR
or
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
option that was used previously to disable the configuration cache\&.
.sp
This option was added in MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.0\&.15 and MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.1\&.4\&.
.sp
Beginning with MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.0\&.31 and MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.1\&.20,
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
no longer checks for the configuration directory (\fB\-\-configdir\fR) or attempts to create one when
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
is used\&. (Bug #13428853)

.sp
This differs in two ways from the

When starting a MySQL Cluster is configured with two management nodes and running MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.0 and later, each management server normally checks to see whether the other
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
is also operational and whether the other management server\'s configuration is identical to its own\&. However, it is sometimes desirable to start the cluster with only one management node (and perhaps to allow the other
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
to be started later)\&. This option causes the management node to bypass any checks for any other management nodes whose node IDs are passed to this option, permitting the cluster to start as though configured to use only the management node that was started\&.

and running on the host having the IP address 192\&.168\&.0\&.150\&. (Suppose, for example, that the host computer on which you intend to the other management server is temporarily unavailable due to a hardware failure, and you are waiting for it to be repaired\&.) To start the cluster in this way, use a command line on the machine at 192\&.168\&.0\&.150 to enter the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgmd \-\-ndb\-nodeid=10 \-\-nowait\-nodes=11\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
As shown in the preceding example, when using
\fB\-\-nowait\-nodes\fR, you must also use the
\fB\-\-ndb\-nodeid\fR
option to specify the node ID of this
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
process\&.
.sp
You can then start each of the cluster\'s data nodes in the usual way\&. If you wish to start and use the second management server in addition to the first management server at a later time without restarting the data nodes, you must start each data node with a connectstring that references both management servers, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndbd \-c 192\&.168\&.0\&.150,192\&.168\&.0\&.151\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The same is true with regard to the connectstring used with any
\fBmysqld\fR
processes that you wish to start as MySQL Cluster SQL nodes connected to this cluster\&. See
Section\ \&17.3.2.3, \(lqThe MySQL Cluster Connectstring\(rq, for more information\&.
.sp
When used with
\fBndb_mgmd\fR, this option affects the behavior of the management node with regard to other management nodes only\&. Do not confuse it with the
\fB\-\-nowait\-nodes\fR
option used with
\fBndbd\fR
(or
\fBndbmtd\fR
in MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.0 and later) to permit a cluster to start with fewer than its full complement of data nodes; when used with data nodes, this option affects their behavior only with regard to other data nodes\&.
.sp
Multiple management node IDs may be passed to this option as a comma\-separated list\&. Each node ID must be no less than 1 and no greater than 255\&. In practice, it is quite rare to use more than two management servers for the same MySQL Cluster (or to have any need for doing so); in most cases you need to pass to this option only the single node ID for the one management server that you do not wish to use when starting the cluster\&.

When you later start the
\(lqmissing\(rq
management server, its configuration must match that of the management server that is already in use by the cluster\&. Otherwise, it fails the configuration check performed by the existing management server, and does not start\&.

This option was introduced in MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.0\&.10 and MySQL Cluster NDB 7\&.1\&.0\&.

It is not strictly necessary to specify a connectstring when starting the management server\&. However, if you are using more than one management server, a connectstring should be provided and each node in the cluster should specify its node ID explicitly\&.

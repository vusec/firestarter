# The following fails sporadically because 'check-testcase' runs
# queries before this test and there is no way to guarantee that any
# previous process finishes.  The purpose of the test is not clearly
# stated, there is no reference to any bug report, and "select from
# I_S from prepared statement" doesn't look like something that's
# really imporant to test.  I'm commenting out this for now.  If
# anyone wants to keep this, please fix the race and motivate why we
# need to test this.  If you see this comment and it is after mid-2009
# or so, feel free to remove this test from the file.  /Sven

## We don't have any 4.1 tests as we use I_S to query the PROCESSLIST to
## exclude system threads that may/may not be active in the server
## (namely the ndb injector thread)

/*
  Puts the given string to the buffer.

  SYNOPSIS
    append()
    position          start position in the buffer
    string            string to be put in the buffer
    len_arg           the length of the string. This way we can avoid some
                      strlens.

  DESCRIPTION

    The method puts a string into the buffer, starting from position .
    In the case when the buffer is too small it reallocs the buffer. The
    total size of the buffer is restricted with 16.

  RETURN
    0 - ok
    1 - got an error in reserve()

/*
  Checks whether the current buffer size is ok to put a string of the length
  "len_arg" starting from "position" and reallocs it if no.

  SYNOPSIS
    reserve()
    position          the number starting byte on the buffer to store a buffer
    len_arg           the length of the string.

  DESCRIPTION

    The method checks whether it is possible to put a string of the "len_arg"
    length into the buffer, starting from "position" byte. In the case when the
    buffer is too small it reallocs the buffer. The total size of the buffer is
    restricted with 16 Mb.

  RETURN
    0 - ok
    1 - realloc error or we have come to the 16Mb barrier

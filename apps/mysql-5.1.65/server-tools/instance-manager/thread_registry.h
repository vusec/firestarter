/*
  A multi-threaded application shall nicely work with signals.

  This means it shall, first of all, shut down nicely on ``quit'' signals:
  stop all running threads, cleanup and exit.

  Note, that a thread can't be shut down nicely if it doesn't want to be.
  That's why to perform clean shutdown, all threads constituting a process
  must observe certain rules. Here we use the rules, described in Butenhof
  book 'Programming with POSIX threads', namely:
  - all user signals are handled in 'signal thread' in synchronous manner
  (by means of sigwait). To guarantee that the signal thread is the only who
  can receive user signals, all threads block them, and signal thread is
  the only who calls sigwait() with an apporpriate sigmask.
  To propogate a signal to the workers the signal thread sets
  a variable, corresponding to the signal. Additionally the signal thread
  sends each worker an internal signal (by means of pthread_kill) to kick it
  out from possible blocking syscall, and possibly pthread_cond_signal if
  some thread is blocked in pthread_cond_[timed]wait.
  - a worker handles only internal 'kick' signal (the handler does nothing).
  In case when a syscall returns 'EINTR' the worker checks all
  signal-related variables and behaves accordingly.
  Also these variables shall be checked from time to time in long
  CPU-bounded operations, and before/after pthread_cond_wait. (It's supposed
  that a worker thread either waits in a syscall/conditional variable, or
  computes something.)
  - to guarantee signal deliverence, there should be some kind of feedback,
  e. g. all workers shall account in the signal thread Thread Repository and
  unregister from it on exit.

  Configuration reload (on SIGHUP) and thread timeouts/alarms can be handled
  in manner, similar to ``quit'' signals.
